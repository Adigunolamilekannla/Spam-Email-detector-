# 📧 Spam Email Detector using NLP & Machine Learning

This project is all about teaching machines to recognize **spam emails** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. By training on a large dataset of emails and experimenting with different models, the goal is to build an effective system that can automatically classify messages as either **spam** or **not spam**.

### 🔍 What It Does

* Uses NLP techniques to process and clean email text.
* Trains multiple models (like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) to classify emails.
* Compares model performance to find the most accurate one.
* Provides a simple way to test and evaluate results.

### 🤖 Models Used

Some of the models we trained on include:

* Naive Bayes
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Random Forest
* (and more!)

### 🧠 NLP Techniques

We apply common NLP steps like:

* Text cleaning (removing stop words, punctuation, etc.)
* Tokenization
* TF-IDF vectorization
* Word embeddings (optional depending on the model)


### 💡 Why This Project?

Spam emails are annoying — and sometimes dangerous. Using NLP and machine learning, we can help create smarter filters that keep inboxes clean and safe.
